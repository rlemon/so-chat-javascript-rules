<!-- Basics
================================================== -->
<section id="basics">

    <h1>Basics</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="row">

    <div class="span6">
		<ul>
			<li>Do not spam. This is a fairly simple rule, do not repost questions because you did not get an answer right away. It was likely we read it and just didn't care. Tough luck. There are times when the room gets carried away with images or oneboxes, but this is no excuse to make a habbit of it.</li>
			<li>Do not Help Vampire... Seriously, we all have to learn this shit and you should too! Don't expect us to write your code for you unless you are willing to shell out a bit of dough. For more details see <a href="#">Asking for Help</a>.</li>
			<li>If you are going to post code, please learn how to properly format it. The chat formatting is pretty simple and a quick visit to our <a href="#">FAQ</a> should clear some things up for you. <em>Be Warned! Unformatted code will likely be binned.</em></li>
			<li>Generally we like to be respectful. This does not mean we cannot disagree of have a constructive argument, but name calling and offensive behaviour will not be tolorated.</li>
		</ul>
    </div>

    <div class="span6">
		<ul>
			<li>If you want to play with the <a href="#">ChatBot</a> please do so in the <a href="#">Sandbox</a> room. Don't flood the Javascript room learning commands or trying to hack hangman.</li>
			<li>There is no need to ask to ask a question. For more details see <a href="#">Asking for Help</a>.</li>
			<li>The room title is Javascript, which only implies we all have some interest in the language. That does not strictly limit the topic of conversation to Javascript, and often it is not about Javascript. Please do not inturrupt and complain about this, if you have a comment about the language toss it in and if someone is interested they will stop and help.</li>
			<li>THE GAME!</li>

<!-- Etiquette
================================================== -->
<section id="etiquette">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Etiquette</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
	<p>This is a very simple guideline for everyone to follow. We are all adults and come from different walks of life, we will not always see eye to eye on political or religious topics... However this is also the internet and these topics do come up from time to time. Please be respectful when discussing them and be prepared to cease discussion if someone asks you too. I am not for censorship but there is a proper forum for this type of discussion and in the case of someone being offended by it that forum should then be used in lieu of this one.</p>
	<p>Some people see languages as religions, this cannot be avoided. We all hate Java but we shouldn't lynch the people who write it. CoffeeScript might not be your cup of joe, so if someone is soliciting help in it, just ignore the conversation. Please use common sense while chatting in the room. We don't want to flag people but we will.</p>
	<p>Swearing is tolorated so long as 1) you are not using it to insult another user. 2) you are not throwing around curse words like a 10 year old at summer camp. We understand emphesis and frustration can result in a fuck or two, but just try not to get out of hand.</p>
	<p>Animated gifs are fun, and often entertaining and we all (mostly) enjoy them... at first. There is a timeout on editing posts, please take note of how long said timeout is and "un-onebox" the gif before it is too late. People like to enjoy the gif once, maybe twice, but over and over until the conversation pushes it off screen is annoying.</p>
